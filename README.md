# Flexbox Basics

'A CSS3 layout mode that provides an easy an clean way to arrange items within an container.' 

Note that older CSS used BLOCK model, where you assigned widths (percentages/fixed widths) and you used FLOATS to arrange items on the page. 
You had to do the maths to arrange the items on screen. 

## Why Flexbox?
	- Flexbox has NO Floats!
	- Responsive.
	- Position child elements is easy.
	- Flex containers margins do not collapse with the margins of its contents. 
	- Order of elements can easily be changed without editing the source HTML. 

Direction Agnostic, Vertical and horizontal
